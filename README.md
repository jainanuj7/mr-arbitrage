# What is Arbitrage?
In a nutshell, arbitrage (when it comes to trading) is a strategy to take advantage of differences in prices across markets to make profit. We can take roses as a simple example — for special events such as Valentine’s Day, usually emotionless people like myself forget to purchase roses for others. By the time we’re at the doorstep, we realize that we don’t have roses — luckily, there’s someone standing on the corner ready to fully take advantage of our desperation.

**A dozen roses for $50. Ouch.**

But apart from realizing to plan ahead next time, the bigger lesson here is how the rose seller took advantage of a situation to profit. He or she probably just went to the supermarket a week or month prior to order tons of roses very cheap, to be delivered on the night before Valentine’s Day. He saw an opportunity to buy roses cheap somewhere and sell somewhere else for more expensive, which landed him profit. This is arbitrage.

**Except in the trading world, there is no waiting — arbitrage opportunities come and go in the blink of an eye. Sometimes selling and buying must even occur simultaneously.**
