# ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE : I am not mainintaning this repository anymore because CRYPTO IS DEAD IN INDIA, thanks to Supreme Court of India. :(
Zebpay APIs are down, Coindelta have suspended its services and whatever arbitrage it is showing might be misleading due to very low trade  volume of leftover btc.
## If you feel this was a great idea take this idea forward for other Crypto Exchanges that are live with considerable amount of trade volume. Fork it üç¥ and take it forward!
## PS: I always regret for not taking screenshots when crypto market in India was at its peak, and this app was useful to frequent traders. :(

# What is Arbitrage?
In a nutshell, arbitrage (when it comes to trading) is a strategy to take advantage of differences in prices across markets to make profit. We can take roses as a simple example‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor special events such as Valentine‚Äôs Day, usually emotionless people like myself forget to purchase roses for others. By the time we‚Äôre at the doorstep, we realize that we don‚Äôt have roses‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääluckily, there‚Äôs someone standing on the corner ready to fully take advantage of our desperation.

**A dozen roses for $50. Ouch.**

But apart from realizing to plan ahead next time, the bigger lesson here is how the rose seller took advantage of a situation to profit. He or she probably just went to the supermarket a week or month prior to order tons of roses very cheap, to be delivered on the night before Valentine‚Äôs Day. He saw an opportunity to buy roses cheap somewhere and sell somewhere else for more expensive, which landed him profit. This is arbitrage.

**Except in the trading world, there is no waiting‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääarbitrage opportunities come and go in the blink of an eye. Sometimes selling and buying must even occur simultaneously.**
